<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h3 align="left">We are creating a Hotel Management System that involves various components such as handling reservations, check-ins, check-outs, and managing data efficiently. Here's an outline for implementing this system using data structures, algorithms, and file handling in a programming language like C++</h3>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align = "justify">UTMHotel Management System is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate hotel operations at UTM hotels. It serves as a centralized platform to efficiently manage various tasks and enhance guest experiences while optimizing the hotel's operational efficiency.
The UTMHotel system incorporates robust sorting algorithms to organize reservations, rooms, and guest data. Additionally, it utilizes efficient searching algorithms for rapid access to guest information and room availability.
